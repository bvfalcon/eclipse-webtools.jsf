<h1>JSF Libraries</h1>
<br>
A JSF Library is very similar in concept to the Eclipse JDT User Library.   They are meant to be named collections of jars that can be added as references to a Dynamic Web Project.  
A JSF Library differs from a JDT User Library in the following ways:
<ul>
<li>A JSF Libary can be marked for deployment to the WEB-INF/lib directory</li>
<li>A JSF Library can be created procedurally by an extender</li>
<li>A JSF Library can be marked as an implementation</li>
<li>A JSF Library reference is currently not implemented as a classpath container variable reference</li>
<li>The JSF Library Registry, that is persisted for a workspace, is currently not importable or exportable</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Implementations vs Component Libraries</h3>
<br>
A JSF Library is just a set of jars that will be put on the classpath and optionally deployed to the WEB-INF/lib directory at publish time using the J2EE Module Dependencies.   Why do some libraries have the "implementation" flag?
A library marked as a JSF implementation differentiates it from a normal set of jars that make up a library.  This flag is meant as an on-your-honor marking that this set of jars meets the JSF specification for an implementation.  
The JSF tooling requires a Faces Servlet implementation for compilation and "Run on Server" feature of a JSF JSP page.  
</p>
<h3>Plugin-Provided Libraries</h3>
<br>
An adopter of the WTP JSF Tooling may create a plugin that extends <code>org.eclipse.jst.jsf.core.jsflibraries</code> which would allows a developer to procedurally create a JSF Library.   This, in theory, would simplify project configuration and could also enable the adopter to provide other tool extensions to improve the development experience. 
<br><br>
Plugin-provided libaries are not editable or deletable by an end user.
