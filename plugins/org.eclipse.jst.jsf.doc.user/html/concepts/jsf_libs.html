<h1>JSF Libraries</h1>
<br>
A JSF Library is very similar in concept to the Eclipse JDT User Library.   They are meant to be named collections of jars that can be added as references to a Dynamic Web Project.  
A JSF Library differs from a JDT User Library in the following ways:
<ul>
<li>A JSF Libary can be marked for deployment to the WEB-INF/lib directory</li>
<li>A JSF Library can be created procedurally by an extender</li>
<li>A JSF Library can be marked as an implementation</li>
<li>A JSF Library reference is currently not implemented as a classpath container variable reference</li>
<li>The JSF Library Registry, that is persisted for a workspace, is currently not importable or exportable</li>
</ul>
