# Eclipse Tools for Jakarta Faces

This repository is based on [Eclipse Tools for Faces](https://github.com/eclipse-jsf/webtools.jsf) and aims to adapt original project for latest Jakarta Faces specifications. More specifically, there are two targets in progress:

* improve support of Jakarta Faces specifications (3.0 and later)

* stay compatible with JavaServer Faces (2.3 and earlier)

After both targets will be achieved at mature level, this project and its artifacts will be a part of original project.

But before that moment artifacts of this project could be installed from this [eclipse update site](https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/github.bvfalcon/webtools.jakarta-faces/). Install it with Eclipse IDE menu "Help -> Install New Software -> &lt;Add&gt;"
